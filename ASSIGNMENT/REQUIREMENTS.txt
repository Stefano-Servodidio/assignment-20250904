Requirements
Build a single-page application (SPA) that consumes the All Leagues API and displays
the sports leagues with filtering options.
● Fetch and display a list of sports leagues.
● Display Fields:
o strLeague
o strSport
o strLeagueAlternate
● Add a search bar to filter leagues by name.
● Add a dropdown to filter by sport type (e.g., Soccer, Basketball, Motorsport).
● Use component-based architecture.
● The UI should be responsive and functional as a priority, visual enhancements can be
added if time allows
The league entities respond to clicks and call the Season Badge API with the league ID to
display a season badge image (can be for any season you like or the first entity in the response).
● Responses should be cached to avoid repeat callstrDescriptionEN
